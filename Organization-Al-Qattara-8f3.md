# Title: Al-Qattara

Al-Qattara is a sprawling desert realm in Eldoria, a land of shifting sands, ancient ruins, and mystical oases. It's a place where the line between the material world and the arcane is thin, and where the Catfolk, known locally as the "Qattari," have thrived for centuries. The realm is a blend of harsh survival and mystical wonder, where the Catfolk have learned to harness both the arcane and the natural resources to survive and prosper.
