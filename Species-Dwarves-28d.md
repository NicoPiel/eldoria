# Title: Dwarves

In the rugged mountains of Drakar Peaks, the dwarves of Eldoria have carved out a kingdom that stands as a testament to their resilience, craftsmanship, and indomitable spirit. Bound by strong clan ties and a deep sense of tradition, these stout folk are master miners, engineers, and warriors. Their cities, often built deep within the mountains, are marvels of stonemasonry and metallurgy, with intricate architecture and complex tunnel systems that baffle even the most skilled cartographers.
The dwarves are governed by a council of clan leaders, each representing one of the ancient families that first settled Drakar Peaks. The clans, while fiercely independent, come together in times of crisis, united by their reverence for Kardain Flamebeard, their principal god, and their shared history. The Heartforge in Anvil's Rest and the Eternal Flame are considered the spiritual centers of dwarven culture, attracting pilgrims from all corners of the kingdom.

Known for their strong work ethic and an almost religious devotion to their crafts, dwarven blacksmiths and artisans are highly sought after. The veins of "Royal Iron" that run through their lands are a closely guarded secret, and the weapons and armor they forge from it are considered some of the finest in Eldoria. Despite their somewhat insular nature, dwarves are not isolationists. They are skilled traders and their caravans are a common sight in the markets of Valoria and Eldarwood, offering meticulously crafted goods in exchange for magical artifacts, spices, and other exotic wares.
