# Title: Marius Corvin

Lord Marius is a steadfast member of the old guard, using his control of the Greywood to supply the rebellion. His greatest challenge is not the watchful eye of the hierocracy, but the ideological enemy within his own home: his daughter, Lyra.

[h2|3495164a-aa83-4c34-9b37-9ea5a2c58807]Personality[/h2]
Traditionalist, proud, stubborn, deeply resentful of the new order. He is a committed, if somewhat unimaginative, conspirator.

[h2|a0b87848-5c69-4ee9-86a2-5f7f13a274bf]Appearance[/h2]
A sturdy, broad-shouldered man with a weathered face and a thick grey mustache. He looks more like a master woodsman than a high lord.

[h2|b284d517-a65b-4220-aa29-97f4dc65d27b]Goals[/h2]
To uphold his oaths to the Shadow Court and contribute to the restoration of the old noble order, which he sees as the natural way of the world.
