# Title: Drow

The Drow, known among themselves as the Velkharim, are an ancient, enigmatic species native to the mists and marshes of Shadowfen. Long before tieflings, humans, or elves ever set foot in the region, the Velkharim walked its sodden paths, their cities hidden among sunken roots, forgotten ruins, and dream-veiled waters.

Often misjudged by outsiders as twisted reflections of elvesâ€”a comparison they view with quiet disdain. They are their own ancient lineage, shaped not by sun or sky, but by generations of survival within a land of fog, shadow, and silence.
