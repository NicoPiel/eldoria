# Title: Rhys Sunder

Rhys is the tragic living consequence of failed rebellion. His existence as a terrified, obedient lord is a powerful piece of propaganda for the hierocracy, a constant reminder to other houses of the price of defiance.

[h2|b4c32ae6-1535-4f34-bdc3-de092e03bf27]Personality[/h2]
Traumatized, fearful, anxious, subservient. He is utterly broken by his past and lives in constant terror of the hierocracy.

[h2|71c7948d-6dcd-4fe7-90f5-125f25cc4882]Appearance[/h2]
Thin and pale, with large, haunted dark eyes and a nervous tremor in his hands. He is often hunched over, as if expecting a blow.

[h2|80b2d7b3-1de7-4c14-9b38-7282dfb5578b]Goals[/h2]
To avoid notice. To do anything and everything the local priests ask of him to prevent any further harm from befalling the remnants of his family.
