# Title: Dagna I. of Clan Silverstream

Dagna is a wise and formidable dwarf, deeply committed to upholding the traditions and spiritual practices that have defined Anvil's Rest for millennia. She's known for her stern demeanor, but those who know her well speak of her deep sense of responsibility and unshakable faith in Kardain Flamebeard.
# The Challenges of Modern Times

Dagna faces a host of challenges that her ancestors could scarcely have imagined. The never-depleting vein in Iron Deep has shifted some of the economic power away from Anvil's Rest, and the younger generation is increasingly drawn to the allure of the outside world. Yet, Dagna remains steadfast in her commitment to the spiritual well-being of her people and the sanctity of the Eternal Flame.
# The Spiritual Leader

As the head of Clan Silverstream and the leader of Anvil's Rest, Dagna also serves as the high priestess in ceremonies dedicated to Kardain Flamebeard. She is the keeper of ancient rituals and the one who leads the renewal of the Covenant of Flame and Stone during major festivals.
# The Diplomat

Dagna is not just a spiritual leader; she's also a skilled diplomat. She maintains a delicate balance of power with the leaders of Iron Deep and other dwarven cities, ensuring that Anvil's Rest remains a respected voice in dwarven politics. She's also been known to send envoys to other races and kingdoms, spreading the teachings of Flamebeard and seeking knowledge that might benefit her people.
# The Legacy

Dagna is keenly aware of her lineage and the weight of her responsibilities. She has no children of her own but has adopted a promising young dwarf named Eirik, training him in the ways of leadership and spirituality, preparing him to one day take up the mantle and continue the Silverstream legacy.
