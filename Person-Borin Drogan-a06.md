# Title: Borin Drogan

Lord Borin is the unsubtle hammer of the noble rebellion. He makes no secret of his hatred for the new regime and commands the fierce loyalty of his miners and soldiers. He eagerly awaits the signal from [[House Valerius]] to unleash his forces upon the Royal Province.

[h2|888b8f1e-f612-4b64-8116-5d3966817a6b]Personality[/h2]
Gruff, proud, stubborn, fiercely loyal to his own people. He has no patience for subtlety or diplomacy and views the priests with undisguised contempt.

[h2|48ff9bab-8405-42d8-8420-5f5a434b3584]Appearance[/h2]
A mountain of a man with a powerful build, a wild, thick grey-streaked beard, and hands calloused from wielding both a smith's hammer and a battle axe. His eyes are a stormy grey.

[h2|cdca33de-accb-4f86-92bf-0714400e4bb6]Goals[/h2]
To amass an army, to see the priests driven from his lands, and to personally tear down the brass gates of the Radiant Basilica.
