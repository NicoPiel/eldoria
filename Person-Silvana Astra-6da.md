# Title: Silvana Astra

The reluctant keeper of secrets, Lady Silvana presides over the Shadow Court's primary meeting place at [[Moonrise]]. A living link to the pre-Fracture world, she sees the current conflict as just one more destructive chapter in a long history, and she mourns the knowledge that will inevitably be lost.

[h2|1d5c7851-7560-4bb1-a36c-50df78254470]Personality[/h2]
Scholarly, detached, serene, melancholic. Her primary concern is the preservation of knowledge and her family, not politics.

[h2|5a1367c9-eece-4c5c-96fc-443ca16e9956]Appearance[/h2]
A thin, frail woman with wispy white hair and skin like old parchment. Her pale blue eyes hold a deep, ancient wisdom and sadness. She moves slowly, often leaning on a carved staff.

[h2|529d3214-3dd2-4c18-bf14-fbfb16853371]Goals[/h2]
To protect her library and her family from the coming storm. She plays the part assigned to her by House Valerius out of necessity, not allegiance.
