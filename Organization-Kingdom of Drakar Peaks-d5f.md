# Title: Kingdom of Drakar Peaks

Drakar Peaks is a Dwarven kingdom located within the formidable mountain range [[of the same name]]. To outsiders, it is a remote and powerful bastion of unparalleled craftsmanship. The truth, however, is a deeply held secret: the mountain range is no mere stone, but the colossal, petrified corpse of a long-dead primordial entity known as a [[Behemoth]]. The entire Dwarven civilization is built within this fallen god, and their society, culture, and laws are all shaped by the unique realities of living inside their sacred ancestor.

# Governance and Society

The society of Drakar Peaks is a Conditional Monarchy built upon a foundation of meritocracy. The core principle is that survival and prosperity depend on every dwarf serving in the role for which they have the most talent. This is enforced through a societal structure known as The Proving.

## The Proving: A Meritocratic Society

Dwarves are not born into their clans; they must earn their place.

### The Unblooded:
All dwarves are born clan-less, known as the Unblooded. They receive a general education in the history of the Fallen Behemoth and the basics of all the clans' crafts.
### The Proving:
Upon coming of age, an Unblooded dwarf declares their intent to join a clan, becoming an Aspirant. They undergo years of rigorous apprenticeship, training under the clan's masters. Success is not just about competence, but about demonstrating an innate talent for the clan's duties.
### The Clan Rune:
Aspirants who pass The Proving are accepted into the clan during a solemn ceremony where they are bestowed a Clan Rune, a permanent mark of their station and skill, often as a brand or tattoo.
### The Clanless:
Those who fail The Proving, or refuse to undertake it, form the social underclass known as The Clanless. They perform essential but unglamorous labor and hold no political power, creating a significant source of social tension. Though they are officially not looked down upon, many clan-bound Dwarves feel superior to the Clanless.

## The Tiers of Government

### The Monarch: The Behemoth's Will:
The King or Queen of the Peaks (currently King Thraindor II) is the spiritual and ultimate ruler. The monarch must come from Clan Heartward and can only ascend to the Iron Throne after completing the Royal Proving—a series of trials where they must prove their competence not just with their own clan, but with all six. This ensures the ruler has a holistic understanding of the kingdom.

### The High Council: The Behemoth's Hands:
The kingdom's primary governing body, composed of the six Clan Masters. A Clan Master is the dwarf acknowledged by their peers to be the absolute pinnacle of their craft. The Council manages the day-to-day operations of the kingdom, from resource allocation to defense.

### The Assembly: The Behemoth's Voice:
An advisory body of respected representatives from each clan. The Assembly can bring petitions and grievances from the populace to the High Council, ensuring the leadership does not lose touch with the common dwarf.

## The Six Clans

The six great clans are the pillars of Dwarven society, each responsible for a critical function related to living within the Behemoth.

### Clan Heartward
The royal clan and guardians of the Behemoth's inert, shattered Heartstone Chamber in the capital of Azankâr. They are responsible for law, order, and preserving the most sacred parts of the kingdom. Their leadership is defined by immense, solemn responsibility.
 
### Clan Bonehewers
The kingdom's architects and engineers. They are master anatomists of the Behemoth, understanding its fossilized structure to safely carve halls, tunnels, and cities without causing a collapse.
 
### Clan Veinminers
The miners and gemologists who harvest the "blood" of the Behemoth—the veins of precious metals and gems that course through its body. They are expert prospectors, seeing mining as a sacred harvest.

### Clan Echo-Hammer
The warriors and defenders of Drakar Peaks. They protect the kingdom from threats, particularly the magical "carrion-eaters" (e.g., bone-worms, crystalline parasites) drawn to the Behemoth's decaying divine essence. Their name comes from their tunnel-fighting style using sonic reverberations.

### Clan of the Heralds
The traders, diplomats, and clergy. They are the face of the kingdom to the outside world, managing trade and ensuring the Behemoth's sacred remains are treated with respect. The Dwarven clergy, led by the Forgefather, preaches the faith of the Fallen Behemoth.

### Clan Rimeshield
Hardy explorers and survivalists who live on the "skin" of the Behemoth. They patrol the icy mountain exteriors, serving as the kingdom's first line of defense against surface-world threats.
