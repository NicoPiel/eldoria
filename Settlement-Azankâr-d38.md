# Title: Azankâr

Azankâr is the heart of the kingdom in every sense of the word. Carved from the Behemoth's gargantuan chest cavity, it is the largest and most magnificent of the dwarven holds.
 Location: Built within the titanic rib cage, with the Iron Throne and the halls of Clan Heartward situated at the very center, near the shattered, crystalline remains of the Behemoth's Heartstone.
Layout: A multi-level, vertical city. Great bridges of stone and iron span the chasms between ribs. Waterfalls, channeled from ancient arteries, cascade into deep, echoing lakes. It is a city of immense halls, grand temples, and the ancestral homes of the most powerful families.
Function: The center of government, religion, and high culture. It is where the King rules, the High Council meets, and the most sacred rites to the Behemoth are performed.
