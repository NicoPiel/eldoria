# Title: Vorn Ironhand

Vorn is the uncle of King Thraindor II, the younger brother of the previous king. In his youth, he was also a contender for the throne, but his older brother was chosen to rule. Vorn has since served the kingdom with unyielding dedication, becoming the very embodiment of Heartwarden law and tradition.

If King Thraindor is the kingdom's unifier, Vorn is its anchor. He is stern, deeply traditional, and uncompromising when it comes to the letter of the law. While fiercely loyal to his nephew, he is also his harshest critic, holding the king to the highest possible standard. On the council, he is the voice of absolute order and precedent, often clashing with the more radical or flexible ideas of the other masters.

Vorn is older than the king, with a powerful build that has not yet bowed to age. His beard is more grey than black, cut and bound in a severe, rectangular style that is traditional for his clan's honor guard. His hands are thick and calloused, earning him the name "Ironhand" after he reportedly held a collapsing gate closed with his bare hands during a siege decades ago.
