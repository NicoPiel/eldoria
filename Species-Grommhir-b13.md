# Title: Grommhir

Grommhir are large, mole-like creatures native to Drakar Peaks that have been domesticated by dwarves for their remarkable strength, agility, and keen sense of navigation. They play a vital role in the daily life of dwarves as draft animals, assisting them in excavating new tunnels and halls deep within the mountains.
