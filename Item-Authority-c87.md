# Title: Authority

An ancient tarnished crown, which once wielded the light of ancient divine authority, now lost to darkness. These crowns are broken counterparts to their divine predecessors but wield equally dangerous and powerful magic. Mages who are able to controll the darkness within these crowns are able to summon sparks of the void and use them to their own liking. When a mage was encountered in battle, who wielded one of those crowns, you'd better be alone, else you would need to ultimately cut down your own allies again, after the dark powers of the mages corrupted them and animated their corpse to fight against you.
