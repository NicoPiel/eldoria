# Title: House Corvin

Situated in the strategic western forests, House Corvin is a house at war with itself. The patriarch, **Lord **[[Marius Corvin]], is a traditionalist and a secret member of the Shadow Court, using his control of the timber trade to supply the rebellion. He is directly opposed by his own daughter and heir, [[Yrana Corvin]]. Educated under the new regime, Lyra is a sincere believer in the Renewal's promise of order and justice, and is deeply troubled by her father's treasonous activities. This profound ideological schism threatens to tear the house apart from within and makes its future allegiance a critical, unpredictable factor in the coming conflict.
