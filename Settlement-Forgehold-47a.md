# Title: Forgehold

Nestled in the east-central region of the indomitable Drakar Peaks lies Forgehold, a city that stands as a monument to dwarven ingenuity and craftsmanship. Founded by the venerable Stonemaster Durgan Stoneforge, the city is a labyrinth of artistry and architectural marvels. It's said that Durgan, guided by visions from the gods of craft, discovered a unique type of stone—Eternal Marble—that could be shaped as easily as clay but was as strong as the hardest steel.
As you traverse the winding tunnels that lead to Forgehold, you're greeted by grand archways and intricate stonework that tell stories of the clan's history and achievements. Here, the Stoneforge clan reigns supreme, esteemed for their exceptional skills in crafting and architectural design. They are the master builders of Drakar Peaks, the visionaries who shape the very halls and chambers of the kingdom.

The governance of Forgehold is a collaborative endeavor, a council of master craftsmen and architects who debate and decide on the city's many projects. While they don't hold the political power of Iron Deep, their wisdom in construction and design is unparalleled, making them indispensable advisors for kingdom-wide infrastructural projects. The Council's Chamber, where they meet, is a masterpiece in itself, with a domed ceiling that depicts the constellations of the night sky, each star a precious gem embedded in the rock.

Trade in Forgehold is a bustling affair, focused on the export of crafted goods and architectural plans. The city is home to "The Mason's Library," a vast repository of blueprints, crafting techniques, and magical formulas. Scholars and craftsmen from all over the kingdom come to study here, seeking to unlock the secrets of the Stoneforge clan's unparalleled skill.
