# Title: The Seebund

The **Seebund** is a unique maritime confederation located in the southeastern seas of Eldoria. The nation is comprised of a nomadic, seafaring people known as the Tide-Kin, who spend the majority of their lives in massive mobile fleets. Their society is anchored to a single, industrial city, [[Sturmkap]], located on their volcanic home island.

The Seebund is an archipelago dominated by a large, rugged island. The island's central feature is [[Zornflamme]], a perpetually active volcano. The Tide-Kin believe this volcano is in fact a slumbering, chaotic neutral [[Behemoth]]—a primordial elemental of earth and fire. The unique geology provides the Seebund with exclusive access to several valuable resources:


- Obsidian: The island's beaches are composed of black, wave-tumbled volcanic glass.
- Zorn-Glass: A rare variant of obsidian forged in the extreme heat of the deepest lava tubes. It is supernaturally sharp and durable, making it ideal for elite weapons.
- Sun-Leaf Plant: A unique plant that thrives on the volcano's warm slopes. It is the world's only known source of Sea-Sugar.


## Society and Government

The Tide-Kin are a cohesive society built on the principle of communal duty. Their population is divided into two interdependent groups:


- The Tide-Born: The majority of the population, born and raised on the sea. They live in vast Flotillas—mobile cities of hundreds of interconnected ships—and embody the nomadic soul of the culture. Many Tide-Born will never set foot on land.
- The Land-Walkers: The respected inhabitants of Sturmkap. A Land-Walker is typically a Tide-Born who has undergone the "Pledge of the Stone," a sacred vow to forsake the sea and dedicate their life to the land-based industry that supports the fleets. This is not a lower class, but a position of honored sacrifice.


The Seebund is governed by the Admiral's Council, composed of the admirals from each major Flotilla. They convene annually in Sturmkap to decide matters of law and trade. The council elects one Tide-Lord to act as their head of state and commander-in-chief for a five-year term.

## Economy

The Seebund is an economic powerhouse due to its monopoly on several key goods. While they trade traditional maritime products like salt and pearls, their true wealth comes from:


- Sea-Sugar: As the sole producers, they control the global supply of this luxury good.
- Sturm-Spirit: A potent and highly sought-after amber liquor distilled from Sea-Sugar. The recipe is a fiercely guarded secret.
- Zorn-Glass: While obsidian is sold widely, finished weapons and tools made of Zorn-Glass are rare and incredibly valuable, often used as diplomatic gifts or payment for significant services.


## Culture and Beliefs

Tide-Kin culture is shaped by the three natural forces they revere: Maelora (the Mother Sea), [[Aelios]] (the Sky Father), and the slumbering earth-elemental Zornflamme. Priests, known as **Star-Callers**, are both spiritual guides and master navigators who also lead rituals to keep the Behemoth dormant.

**Key Rituals:** The "First Embrace" (a newborn's first ritual dip in the ocean), the "Final Return" (a burial at sea, considered the most honorable death), and the "Pledge of the Stone."
**Arts: **Their art is practical and portable. It includes intricate knot-work on ropes, scrimshaw on bone, and jewelry made from pearls and polished obsidian.

## Military

The Seebund has no standing army; its navy is its military force. Every Flotilla can be converted into a war fleet, and every merchant is a sailor-warrior.

**Vessels:** Their primary warships are Storm-Drakes, swift and agile vessels built for speed and maneuverability in treacherous waters.
**Tactics:** They avoid direct naval battles against larger, more heavily armed opponents. They specialize in lightning raids, boarding actions, and using their intimate knowledge of reefs, currents, and storms to outwit their enemies.
