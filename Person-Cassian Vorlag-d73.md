# Title: Cassian Vorlag

**Cassian Vorlag** is the current lord of House Vorlag and the hierocracy's most powerful and devoted noble supporter. Even before the Renewal, Lord Cassian was known for his severe nature and his private disgust with the corruption of the southern oligarchs. He viewed the arrival of Altarion and the subsequent coup as a necessary, divine intervention.

He was among the first to swear fealty to [[Altarion, the Dawn Emperor]] , a move that elevated his house from a remote northern warden to a pillar of the new order. In the two years since the Renewal, he has ruled his domain with martial discipline, zealously promoting the faith of Aelios and providing elite troops to the Royal Province. He is widely considered to be a sincere fanatic and a model for the "redeemed" nobility.

Lord Cassian transformed his remote house into a major power by becoming the earliest and most fervent supporter of the Renewal. He sees the new order not as an opportunity, but as a divine destiny. His fanaticism is genuine, born from a disgust with the old oligarchs and gratitude for the hierocracy's aid against his local enemies. He is the unshakable northern pillar of the regime.

[h2|6912de44-220b-4f16-a75c-3b16b642a5b3]Personality[/h2]
Severe, disciplined, devout, uncompromising. A brilliant military strategist who sees moral ambiguity as a personal failing. He is utterly sincere in his faith.

[h2|b993c956-837b-45b8-8a30-f530921d2177]Appearance[/h2]
Tall and lean, with a face that looks carved from granite. His dark hair is cropped short, and his grey eyes are piercing and miss nothing. He bears a long scar along his jawline from fighting the northern mountain clans. He is never seen in anything but his severe, practical military attire or formal House Vorlag armor.

[h2|f35d286a-cf09-41a1-9b19-7f8a837dff78]Goals[/h2]
To secure the northern frontier, to serve the Dawn Emperor as his sword against the shadow, and to purge any lingering heresy or noble corruption from The Reach.
