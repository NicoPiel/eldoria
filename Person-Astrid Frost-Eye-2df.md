# Title: Astrid Frost-Eye

Astrid is a quiet, intense dwarf whose authority was earned on the unforgiving surface of the Behemoth. As is common for her clan, she is laconic and deeply pragmatic, having little time for the deep-hall politics of the Council. She speaks only when she has something vital to say, and her words carry the weight of experience. Her perspective is unique, shaped by the sun, moon, and stars, and she often provides insights the other masters, dwelling in the deep, cannot conceive of.
