# Title: Hamm창zd청m

Located within one of the Behemoth's colossal, petrified arms. Hamm창zd청m is less a city and more a single, contiguous fortress. It is the kingdom's primary garrison and armory. The great halls are utilitarian barracks, the caverns are weapon forges ringing with the sound of a thousand hammers, and the vast, hollowed-out shoulder joint serves as the **Echoing Halls**, their primary training arena.
