# Title: Hakkon Iron-Fist

The belligerent and proactive Master of the Hammers, Hakkon is the kingdom's shield and sword. He is a veteran of countless battles. He believes that a strong offense is the only reliable defense and constantly pushes the Council to fund more patrols and pre-emptive strikes. He respects strength and results above all and has little patience for diplomacy or what he sees as unnecessary deliberation.
