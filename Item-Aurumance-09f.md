# Title: Aurumance

These crowns are an ornate piece of jewelry passed along inside royal families found all over Eldoria. Ancient times had many kinds of these crowns, yet in war or conquest some of the royal families either lost their crowns or they got destroyed. Due to the high magical requirements to be able to wield this piece of accessoire, many families chose their successor based on their ability to wield magic and controll it. This forced families to teach or inherit magical properties to be able to compete with other families, some of which brought forth some of the most powerfull mages to ever wander Eldoria.
