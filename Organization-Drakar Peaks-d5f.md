# Title: Drakar Peaks

# Overview
Drakar Peaks, a formidable mountain range with peaks that pierce the skies, conceals beneath its stony exterior a kingdom of unparalleled craftsmanship and stoic resilience. The dwarves of this subterranean realm have carved out a society that is as steadfast as the rock and stone that encases it. The kingdom, while seemingly impenetrable from the outside, is a bustling, vibrant civilization within, where the echoes of forges meld with hearty laughter in the deep halls of stone.
## King and Queen of Drakar Peaks
Governing body of Drakar Peaks, residing in the current capitol city Irondeep, is the current king Thraindor II. and his queen Traina. The kings and queens are chosen through lineage, even though the lineage can certainly change due to different events. The kings and queens of Drakar Peaks trace back through generations of dwarven rules and they sit upon the Iron Throne, guiding the kingdom with a firm yet fair hand.
The monarch governs with a philosophy that values craftsmanship, loyalty, and tradition, ensuring that the kingdom remains steadfast amidst the shifting sands of time.
## The High Council of the Peaks
Directly subordinate to the king is The High Council of the Peaks consisting of the six mastercraftsmen of each of the six clans in Drakar Peaks. The council once consisted of seven clans, yet the clan of the Mysticbeards was banished into the underground after they mishandled a shard of eternity and risked the kingdom's wellbeing.
## Clans of the Council
The council now consists of following clans:

- **Clan Ironheart** “Steadfast as Stone, Fierce as Flame” - Residing in the current capitol city, Iron Deep, and heritage of the current king and queen of the Drakar Peaks, this clan is known for their leadership, valor, and mastery in metallurgy

- **Clan Silverstream **“In Streams of Silver, We Navigate”- Residing in Anvil’s Rest, this clan inherits skilled traders and diplomats, ensuring the prosperity and alliances of Drakar Peaks with the world beyond its stone confines.
