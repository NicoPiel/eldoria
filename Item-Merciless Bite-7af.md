# Title: Merciless Bite

The Merciless Bite is an item, that is rarely seen throughout the world of Eldoria. You could consider yourself lucky to witness a vampire of noble blood with these fang caps. If you survive the encounter that is.
Most creatures will never experience these fang caps as they are securely locked away behind the doors of noble vampire families.
These ornate fang caps boost your abilities as a vampire through blood magic and enhance your senses.
