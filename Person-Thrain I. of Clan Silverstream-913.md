# Title: Thrain I. of Clan Silverstream

Thrain was a dwarf of great wisdom and even greater ambition. Born into the nomadic Clan Silverstream, he was always a bit different from his kin. While others were content with the wandering life, Thrain was plagued by visions and dreams that he believed were messages from Kardain Flamebeard himself.
# The Vision
One fateful night, Thrain had a vivid dream where Flamebeard appeared before him, guiding him to a hidden valley nestled within the Drakar Peaks. When he awoke, he knew what he had to do. Convincing his clan to follow him, he led them to the location from his dream. There, they discovered the first vein of Royal Iron and the Eternal Flame.
# The Founding of Anvil's Rest
Recognizing the significance of the find, Thrain immediately ordered the construction of the first Heartforge around the Eternal Flame. He named the settlement Anvil's Rest, symbolizing both the end of their nomadic lifestyle and the new focus on craftsmanship and spiritual connection to the earth.
# The Covenant and Legacy
Thrain was the first to renew the Covenant of Flame and Stone at Anvil's Rest, solidifying the bond between the dwarves and their god. His leadership and vision set the spiritual foundation for all of dwarvenkind, and his teachings are still followed to this day.
# Unification
Thrain's vision and discovery of the Eternal Flame and Royal Iron didn't just inspire his own clan; it drew the attention of other dwarven clans scattered throughout Drakar Peaks. Recognizing the need for unity and the potential for a new era of prosperity and spiritual enlightenment, Thrain extended an invitation to the leaders of these clans. After a series of negotiations, debates, and shared ceremonies around the Eternal Flame, the clans agreed to unite under Thrain's leadership, thus forming the Kingdom of Drakar Peaks.
# Reign
Thrain's reign was marked by stability, spiritual growth, and the establishment of traditions and laws that would govern the dwarves for generations to come. He oversaw the construction of new forges, libraries, and temples, turning Drakar Peaks into a center of dwarven culture and spirituality. His rule was considered fair and just, guided by both the teachings of Flamebeard and the practical needs of a growing kingdom.
# Legacy as King
Thrain's legacy as the first king is still felt today. The laws he enacted, the alliances he formed, and the traditions he established continue to shape the political and spiritual landscape of Drakar Peaks. Every king or queen who has followed owes their position to the foundation that Thrain laid, and it's a common practice for new rulers to pay their respects at his tomb in Anvil's Rest before officially taking the throne.
# The End of His Days
Thrain lived to see Anvil's Rest grow into a thriving spiritual center. He passed away at an old age, his body interred in a grand tomb within the city, near the Heartforge. It's said that his spirit still watches over Anvil's Rest, ensuring that the Covenant remains unbroken.

Thrain Silverstream is revered as a near-mythical figure, a visionary who led his people to their true calling. His legacy is celebrated annually in Anvil's Rest during the Festival of the First Flame, where young dwarves learn the story of their people's spiritual journey.
