# Title: Yrana Corvin

Lyra represents the ideological battle for the future of [[The Reach]]. She is not simply a pawn, but an active participant whose ultimate choice—to support her father's treason or betray him to her faith—could have devastating consequences for the Shadow Court and the stability of the entire western realm.

[h2|b03c55be-cf3b-482d-9186-0653ad133280]Personality[/h2]
Idealistic, earnest, conflicted, intelligent. Torn between her love for her father and her genuine belief in the principles of the Great Renewal.

[h2|80371ea7-5749-41e6-8ac4-b77a9f9e3d4c]Appearance[/h2]
Young and vibrant, with long, dark hair and expressive, thoughtful brown eyes. She has a serious, searching expression and a directness that can be disarming.

[h2|d445abad-e623-4144-9c81-3811b257eac0]Goals[/h2]
To reconcile her faith with her family loyalty. She wants to believe the new regime is just, but cannot ignore her father's treason. She hopes to find a "third way" that doesn't involve destroying one or the other.
