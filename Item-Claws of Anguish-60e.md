# Title: Claws of Anguish

Covered in arcane runes, these bracers possess the dual ability to amplify magical powers and corrupt the minds of their users. The magic within these arm guards flows like a venomous stream into the bloodstream, challenging even the strongest minds to resist their dark whispers. Lost to time but not forgotten, the Claws of Anguish continue to resurface throughout the lands of Eldoria, lying in ancient crypts or wielded by bloodthirsty beings, echoing the chaos and power of a bygone era.
With some luck, you will never encounter someone posessed by the bloodlust this weapon brings with it, but if you do, prepare to fight or be damned.
