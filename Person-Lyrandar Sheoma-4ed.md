**Lore:**

Lyrandar Sheoma, often simply referred to as “The Nightwing”, is a deity revered by nocturnal creatures, adventurers, and those who seek protection in the dark. Before ascending to godhood, Lyrandar was a mortal, an adventurer of great renown who traversed the perilous landscapes of the mortal realm beneath the comforting blanket of the night. His adventures were primarily undertaken under the night sky, utilizing the cover of darkness to protect himself and his allies from the watchful eyes of their enemies.

Lyrandar and his party specialized in rescuing oppressed people and creatures, earning him a particular reverence among bats, who were often misunderstood and mistreated. It’s said, that during one pivotal night, when Lyrandar was severely outnumbered by a horde of enemies, a massive swarm of bats came to his aid, shielding him with their wings and confusing the enemies.

When he eventually passed from the mortal realm – through an act of great sacrifice to save a cavern of innocent creatures – his deeds, stories, and the collective belief and reverence from all creatures alike allowed him to ascend, becoming a deity that watches over the night, offering protection to those who travel under the cover of darkness.

**Dogma:**

• Protectors of the Night – Followers of Lyrandar Sheoma are tasked with safeguarding travelers, creatures, and settlements during the night.

• Seek the Unseen – Lyrandar encourages his followers to explore the mysteries of the world, especially those hidden in darkness, and to uncover and oppose unseen threats.

**Clergy and Temples:**

Priests and acolytes of Lyrandar Sheoma operate primarily after sunset, performing their religious ceremonies beneath the moon and stars. Temples dedicated to The Nightwing are often found in caverns or designed in a way to emulate the night sky, utilizing bioluminescent fungi, enchanted stones, or other means to create a celestial ambiance.

Priests of The Nightwing don robes of deep blues and purples and are often skilled in stealth, survival, and combat, ensuring they can safeguard those traveling during the night. They provide safe havens and assistance to night-time travelers- guide lost souls through the darkness, and ensure safe passages through perilous nocturnal landscapes.


**Festivals and Rituals:**

• The Night’s Embrace – An annual festival celebrated on the longest night of the year, where followers gather to share stories of Lyrandar, partake in nocturnal adventures, and release swarms of bats into the night as a symbol of protection and freedom.

• The Whispering Dark – A monthly ritual where followers gather to silently communicate through a series of coded gestures, teaching them to understand each other without uttering words, thus honoring the silent flight of the bat.

**Pre-ascension Tales of Lyrandar Sheoma in Shadowfen**

1. **The Whispering Marsh Riddle** – Once, Lyrandar traveled to the Whispering Marsh seeking wisdom for an imminent threat. Instead of gaining knowledge directly, the marsh whispered a riddle. With his keen intellect and intuition, Lyrandar deciphered the riddle, leading him to discover a hidden sanctum underneath Duskmire. This discovery prevented a cataclysmic event planned by a rogue faction.

2. **The Veil’s Test** – Lyrandar, seeking allies in his cause, ventured to The Veil. Instead of immediate alliance, the thieves there set him on a series of tasks. Lyrandar, using his unique blend of diplomacy and guile, not only passed their tests but also uncovered traitors within their ranks. This act forged a powerful alliance between him and The Veil.

3. **The Gloomharbor Expedition** – Upon hearing tales of an ancient artifact in distant lands that could potentially amplify the power of shadows, Lyrandar led an expedition from Gloomharbor. This perilous journey through dark waters and treacherous terrains led to the discovery of the “Nightshade Amulet”. Instead of using it for personal gain, Lyrandar entrusted it to the leaders of Shadowfen, further fortifying the region’s mystical defenses.

4. **Wraithwalk’s Pact** – The spiritual realm was unbalanced, and restless spirits roamed Wraithwalk. Lyrandar, with his deep understanding of both the material and ethereal planes, brokered a pact between the living and the dead. This restored harmony to Wraithwalk, making it a hub for spiritualists and mediums.


**The Whispering Marsh Riddle**

**Prelude:**

The Whispering Marsh was renowned in Shadowfen for its enigmatic qualities. A place where the veils between the physical and ethereal realms seemed thin, it was believed that the land itself held ancient knowledge, and it whispered this knowledge to the few who could truly listen. Many had ventured into the marsh seeking guidance, but only a handful returned, their minds filled with cryptic messages and riddles.

When a shadowy threat loomed over Shadowfen, Lyrandar felt an innate calling to seek the counsel of the marsh. As he entered the heart of the marsh, he felt the weight of countless spirits and epochs past, and the marsh whispered its riddle to him.


**The Riddle:**

*“In the realm where shadows dance, beneath the watcher’s vigilant glance,*

*Seek the door that isn’t there, breathe the realm’s of forbidden air.*

*Guarded by the moon’s pale light, the key lays hidden, out of sight.*

*When stars blink and night turns thin, only then, the way you’ll win.”*


**Lyrandar’s Interpretation:**

Lyrandar spent days pondering the riddle’s meaning. Here’s how he deciphered it:

1. “In the realm where shadows dance, beneath the watcher’s vigilant glance,”

Interpretation – This pointed towards Duskmire, the city of shadows. The “watcher” hinted at the central tower in Duskmire, which always had a sentinel keeping watch.

2. “Seek the door that isn’t there, breathe the realm’s forbidden air.”

Interpretation – In the heart of Duskmire, there was an old square where illusions were commonly practiced by local mages. Lyrandar surmised that an illusory wall or barrier might be hiding a concealed door entrance. The “forbidden air” likely indicated that this hidden place was not meant for ordinary folk.

3. “Guarded by the moon’s pale light, the key pays hidden, out of sight.”

Interpretation – This clue hinted at the need to visit this location during a specific lunar phase, possibly a new moon, when the moonlight is faintest. It indicated that the key to this door was hidden, but its visibility or accessibility was tied to the moon’s light.

4. “When stars blink and night turns thin, only then, the way you’ll win.”

Interpretation – The “stars blinking” referred to the rare phenomenon when certain stars, due to atmospheric conditions, appeared to twinkle more vividly. “Night turns thin” hinted at the approaching dawn. Lyrandar realized he had to act during this specific celestial alignment to unveil the door and find the key.

**The Discovery:**

On the night of a new moon, when the stars blinked vividly and dawn was approaching, Lyrandar went to the aforementioned square in Duskmire. As he suspected, an illusory wall faded, revealing a hidden entrance. Using the pale moonlight, he found the key made of pure shadow essence, concealed in a statue’s sillhouette.
Inside, Lyrandar navigated through a labyrinth of corridors and traps until he entered a grand chamber. At its center stood a pedestal bathed in a muted, ethereal glow. Atop the pedestal rested a mythical artifact: The Obsidian Loom.

The Obsidian Loom was said to weave not just fabrics, but fate itself. Legends spoke of its ability to intertwine destinies, allowing its wielder to subtly alter the course of events. Crafted by a forgotten deity of fate, it had vanished from historical records, becoming a myth told to curious children. The artifact, if misused, could entangle the fates of all in Shadowfen, and even Eldoria, leading them to doom.

Lyrandar, recognizing its significance, knew that it could not fall into the wrong hands. He decided to seal the artifact inside a hidden chamber only he knew of and how to get into it, ensuring its safety. In the process of sealing this artifact, he met a little bat-companion, he chose to bind to him with a pact, ultimately evolving its race into Chiroptera, a Bat-Folk that was quick to adapt and live long lives when provided with mana from their pact-partners. This specific little fella of Lyrandar was called Edalyn.
