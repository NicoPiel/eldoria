# Title: History of pre-ascension Zephyria

# History of pre-ascension Zephyria
Zephyria, without the foresight of its eventual ascension, was a grounded marvel of mechanical and magical innovation, reflecting the gnomes’ intrinsic curiosity and inventive spirit.

The architecture was predominantly featuring stone, metal, and wood, with detailed carvings and a smattering of arcane runes practical enchantments.
Buildings were sturdy and grounded, with a focus on horizontal expansion rather than vertical, featuring sprawling complexes of workshops, markets, and residences.
Streets and buildings were adorned with mechanical contraptions like clockwork lamps, automated carriages, and even simplistic robots or constructs aiding in daily tasks. Magic was utilized for a practical and defensive purposes, such as lighting, protective wards, and enhancement of mechanical devices.
Residences where cozy and efficient, with an emphasis on practicality and comfort. Mechanical furniture and storage solutions were maximize space, and small, personal workshops were common. The marketplace was a lively area, with stalls offering a myriad of mechanical and magical goods, from enchanted tools to clockwork toys, reflecting the inventive spirit of Zephyria.

Watchtowers were build to encircle Zephyria, equipped with mechanical and magical defenses to protect against threats from the ground. Mechanical guardians would ensure safety and order within the city.

Green spaces were interspersed throughout the city, providing areas for relaxation and socialization, with no particular emphasis on incorporating greenery into buildings themselves.

Spaces for entertainment and showcasing inventions, such as theaters with mechanically-operated stages and magically-enhanced acoustics, were popular spots.
Access to the isle of Zephyria while still on the ground was granted through the gnomes’ fort, that controlled the bridge made of magic energy supported by electrical and magnetic currents to walk over the waves of the ocean.

The old days of Zephyria, hills, a few dense forests, and serene lakes offered a lush, grounded panorama. The giant Isle anchored in the ocean that was all around it these days. Ships where used to carry goods and people from Zephyria to other cities, providing a bustling, terrestrial dynamic to trade and travel.
Terrestrial and aquatic creatures, from forest-dwelling animals to sea creatures, provided a diverse ecosystem. The parks and other greenery were the home of many different animals, that either fled prior to the ascension or adapted with the gnomes afterwards.

## The Celestial Forge Workshop
A vast, ground-level workshop stood as Zephyria’s heart, with gnomes and other inventors engrossed in creation and innovation. The workshop was a maze of gears, levers, and enchantments, with every nook and cranny utilized for invention.

## The Ascension Event
The skies above Zephyria began to shimmer with an ethereal glow, celestial patterns dancing amidst the clouds, signaling the impending ascension. A palpable tension enveloped the land, as gentle, otherworldly breezes caress the landscapes, and the air becomes saturated with a subtle, electrifying energy. Animals, specially flying species, exhibited unusual behaviours, perhaps flocking towards certain areas or vocalizing unique, melodic calls, as if responding to an unseen, celestial summon.
The Shard of Eternity, secured within a meticulously crafted, mechanical apparatus, began to pulsate with a radiant, celestial light, beams of which pierce the heavens, creating a mesmerizing light show across the skies. The land trembled gently, as the shard’s energy permeates through the earth, causing the landscapes to quiver and undulate, as if becoming unbound from their earthly tethers. Ethereal apparations, perhaps of celestial beings or ancestral spirits, manifested, observing or gently guiding the Zephyrians during this pivotal moment. (At least, that is how the gnomes perceived it)

Massive landmasses, with their lush forests, tranquil lakes, and established settlements, began to gently elevate, the ground beneath them crumbling away and cascading downwards into the abyss below. Zephyrians, witnessing their homeland ascend, experienced a mixture of awe, trepidation, and exhilaration, as they observe familiar landscapes becoming majestic, floating isles. As the land rose, water bodies formed stunning waterfalls, cascading from the newly-formed isles into the skies below, while flora and fauna either adapt to their new, skyborne existence or seek refuge in the remaining grounded regions.

The floating isles, now suspended amidst the boundless skies, drift gently, stabilized by the shard’s energy, with the remnants of their earthly origins visible on their underbellies. Zephyrians began to explore and adapt to their new, celestial environment, establishing pathways between isles, securing unstable regions, and marveling at the boundless horizons now surrounding them. Flora and fauna began to adapt to the skyborne existence, with new, unique ecosystems gradually forming, and Zephyrians exploring the possibilities of agriculture and habitation amidst the skies.

Distant horizons reveal unexplored isles, mysterious celestial phenomena, and potential new allies or adversaries, as Zephyria becomes a ream of boundless exploration. Zephyrians, now navigating through the skies, encounter new creatures, and discover hidden secrets within the floating isles. The ascension reshaped Zephyrians culture, spirituality, and technology, as they embrace their new, semi-celestial existence, their daily lives now intertwined with the mysteries and wonders of the boundless skies.
