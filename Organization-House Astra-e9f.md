# Title: House Astra

A scholarly house dedicated to astronomy and the preservation of knowledge, House Astra lost its independence during the Renewal. Too weak to hold their ancestral home, they were made vassals of House Valerius, who seized Moonrise. Now, under their matriarch, **Lady Silvana Astra**, they maintain a public facade of detached, scholarly neutrality. This neutrality is a fiction curated by their Valerius overlords, allowing Moonrise to function as a secret meeting place for the Shadow Court. While Lady Silvana may personally desire non-interference, her house is now an unwilling but essential component of the rebellion's infrastructure.
