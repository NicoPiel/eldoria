# Title: Elias Quillhart

Meet Professor Elias Quillhart, a distinguished alumnus of Lorelake Academy in his mid-60s. With a keen intellect and a lifetime dedicated to the pursuit of magical history, Elias has contributed significantly to the Grand Library. Now, as Eldoria teeters on the brink of chaos, he embarks on a critical mission: to recover lost shards of the Eternity Crystal or ancient texts that may hold the key to stabilizing the fractured realities.
Don't be fooled by his age; Elias is surprisingly spry and his eyes miss very little. Known for his idiosyncrasies, he takes a moment to clean his half-moon spectacles before examining anything of importance and enjoys puffing on a pipe when deep in thought. With a sense of duty to Lorelake Academy and the world at large, Elias is ready to delve into the mysteries of Eldoria, seeking to unearth secrets that could very well shape the destiny of the realm.
