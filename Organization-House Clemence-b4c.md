# Title: House Clemence

House Clemence controls the fertile riverlands, making them the breadbasket of [[The Reach]]. Their power is not military but logistical. Led by the consummate pragmatist Lord [[Theron Clemence]], the house has positioned itself as an indispensable partner to the hierocracy, ensuring a steady flow of grain to the capital. This collaborative stance, however, is a carefully calculated strategy of opportunism. Lord Clemence maintains deniable contact with the Shadow Court, positioning his house to be the decisive "kingmaker" that will ultimately side with whichever faction appears most likely to triumph, thus ensuring their own prosperity and influence in any future order.
