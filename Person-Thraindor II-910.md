# Title: Thraindor II

Thraindor sits on the Iron Throne as a middle-aged king (by dwarven standards). Having passed the arduous Royal Proving in his youth, he has a deeper understanding of the kingdom's interconnectedness than most. He is a thoughtful and deliberate ruler, deeply concerned with maintaining the delicate balance between the clans. His primary goal is stability, which sometimes puts him at odds with the more ambitious or aggressive members of his council. He is a traditionalist who reveres the memory of the Fallen Behemoth above all else.
