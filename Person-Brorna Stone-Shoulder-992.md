# Title: Brorna Stone-Shoulder

Brorna is a stern, no-nonsense dwarf whose mastery of structural engineering and Behemoth anatomy is legendary. She sees the kingdom not as a city, but as a complex organism that she must keep from collapsing. She is pragmatic to a fault, viewing proposals through a lens of pure structural integrity and long-term stability. She often clashes with Grorim's ambitious mining projects and Hakkon's "brute force" solutions, which she considers dangerously imprecise.
