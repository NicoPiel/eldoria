# Title: House Valerius

Once the wealthiest and most influential of the oligarchs, House Valerius survived the Renewal through a masterful display of public contrition. Now, under the shrewd and secretive leadership of **Lady **[[Aris Valerius]], they orchestrate the entire noble conspiracy known as the Shadow Court. While officially managing the realm's western trade, they use their vast wealth and intelligence networks to fund and organize the resistance. Their seizure of the strategic citadel of [[Moonrise]], which they control through their vassals House Astra, has given them an invaluable, defensible headquarters. House Valerius plays a long game, aiming to dismantle the hierocracy not through brute force, but through precise economic and political sabotage.
