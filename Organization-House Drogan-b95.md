# Title: House Drogan

House Drogan has for generations controlled the rich iron and coal veins of Mount Aethel. A proud and rugged house, they are the most openly defiant of the Pledged nobles. Led by the blunt and aggressive **Lord Borin Drogan**, they barely conceal their contempt for the priests who occupy their lands. Their domain on the eastern slopes of the mountain shares a direct and hostile border with the Royal Province, making it the most likely flashpoint for open war. In the deep, dark forges of Skyreach, House Drogan secretly channels its vast mineral wealth into creating an arsenal for the rebellion, serving as the primary military muscle of the Shadow Court.
