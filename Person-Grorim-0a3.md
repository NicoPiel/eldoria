# Title: Grorim

Grorim is a shrewd and opportunistic dwarf with an unrivaled talent for locating new veins of ore and gems. He is the engine of the kingdom's economy, always pushing for new, ambitious mining operations. He is a gambler at heart, willing to take calculated risks for massive rewards, which puts him in direct opposition to the cautious Brorna Stone-Shoulder. He sees the Behemoth not as a tomb to be preserved, but as a treasure chest waiting to be unlocked.


- **Council Role:** The voice of commerce, resources, and prosperity. The kingdom's lifeblood.
