# Governing Body: The Arcane Council
## Composition
The Arcane Council is the primary governing body of Lorelake Academy. It's composed of esteemed scholars, accomplished mages, and even a few beings from other planes. The council has representatives from each major school of magic taught at the academy, as well as from the faculty and alumni.

## Election and Tenure
Members of the Arcane Council are elected through a complex process that involves both academic merit and magical prowess. Faculty members nominate candidates, who are then vetted through a series of magical and intellectual challenges. The final election is conducted through a magical voting process, where each faculty member casts a spell that encodes their vote into a magical orb. Council members serve for a term of seven years, a number considered magically significant.

## Leadership
The council is led by the Archmage Chancellor, a position of great honor and responsibility. The Archmage Chancellor is elected from among the council members. Once elected, the Archmage Chancellor holds the position for life or until they choose to step down. This tenure is sealed with a magical oath that binds the Chancellor to the academy, ensuring their decisions are made in the institution's best interest. The role of the Archmage Chancellor is to moderate council meetings, represent the academy in external affairs, and ensure that the institution remains true to its mission and values.

## Responsibilities

- Curriculum Oversight: The council reviews and approves the curriculum, ensuring it remains diverse and up-to-date.
- Faculty Appointments: New faculty members are approved by the council, based on recommendations from existing faculty.
- Resource Allocation: Decides how the academy's resources, both magical and financial, are distributed.
- Admission Policies: Sets the criteria for student admissions, including magical aptitude tests and academic prerequisites.
- Conflict Resolution: Acts as the final arbiter in disputes between faculty, students, or different magical schools within the academy.


## Political Dynamics
Given the diverse nature of the council, it's a hotbed of academic rivalry, magical debates, and even some political intrigue. Different schools of magic vie for more representation and resources, and alliances are often formed and broken based on the issues at hand.
