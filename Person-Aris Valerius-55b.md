# Title: Aris Valerius

Lady Aris is the architect of the noble conspiracy. She publicly accepted her house's subjugation while privately masterminding the Shadow Court. From her seat in Sunseat, she directs a vast network of spies and smugglers, patiently weaving a web that she intends to one day draw tight around the Priesthood of [[Aelios]].

[h2|684f75a9-27c5-41c9-9e6b-9bbb4b2e09a9]Personality[/h2]
Patient, analytical, disciplined, utterly ruthless. She operates with the cold precision of a master merchant, viewing people and events as assets and liabilities on a grand balance sheet.

[h2|d27c871d-2357-4365-8aac-3ec1e5b356e0]Appearance[/h2]
Unassuming. She is of average height with plain, dark hair often tied back simply. Her power is not in her looks but in her sharp, intelligent dark eyes that seem to see straight through any pretense. She favors simple, well-made dresses in dark colors, avoiding ostentatious displays of the wealth she secretly commands.

[h2|c35a6043-673f-4aa2-8c56-05e3bf76122b]Goals[/h2]
The complete eradication of the hierocracy and the restoration of a new, Valerius-led oligarchy. Her short-term goals are to fund the resistance, gather intelligence, and turn the Pledged Houses to her cause.
