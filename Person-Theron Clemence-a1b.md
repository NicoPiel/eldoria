# Title: Theron Clemence

Lord Theron is the master of the long game. His control over the realm's food supply makes him indispensable to all factions. He masterfully balances his public support for the hierocracy with his deniable back-channel communications with the Shadow Court, waiting for the opportune moment to pledge his considerable resources to the winning side.

[h2|e86bab49-980a-4004-9819-bf128f1e32bf]Personality[/h2]
Amiable, shrewd, cautious, entirely self-serving. He is a political chameleon, able to present a face of sincere cooperation while making no firm commitments.

[h2|c6e6059f-8523-464d-b0e0-0f2b9b419fee]Appearance[/h2]
A portly man with a florid complexion and thinning brown hair. His smile is quick and his handshake firm. He dresses in the rich, comfortable fabrics of a wealthy landowner, projecting an air of reasonable, prosperous authority.

[h2|bc87067b-bf18-4302-a362-d37cf95dd708]Goals[/h2]
To ensure House Clemence emerges from the current conflict more powerful and wealthier than it was before, regardless of which side wins.
