# Title: Morwen Sunder

The true, vengeful mind of House Sunder. Morwen is a woman who has lost everything and is therefore willing to do anything. While her house is powerless, her personal thirst for revenge makes her a dangerously unpredictable pawn on the board.

Bitter, patient, obsessive, filled with a cold, simmering rage. All her actions are bent towards a single purpose: vengeance.

A gaunt woman with severe features and prematurely grey hair. Her dark eyes burn with a low, intense fire. She dresses in black, as if in perpetual mourning for her house's honor.

To see [[House Vorlag]] and the priests who led the charge against her family utterly destroyed. She is desperately trying to make contact with the Shadow Court to offer herself as an agent.
