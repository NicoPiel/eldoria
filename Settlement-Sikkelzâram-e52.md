# Title: Sikkelzâram

A sprawling, chaotic city deep within the Behemoth's torso, following the richest networks of crystallized veins and arteries. Sikkelzâram is the industrial engine of the kingdom, a city of immense smelters, refineries, and bustling marketplaces trading in raw materials. The air is hot, thick with the tang of metal, and constantly filled with the rumble of mining operations.
