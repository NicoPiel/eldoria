# Title: Fiana Vorlag

A political prisoner in all but name, Lady Fiana was married to Lord Cassian to seal the "loyalty" of the north after her own house was destroyed. She lives in the heart of the regime's most loyal house, a secret dissenter surrounded by fanatics. She is a symbol of the silent suffering upon which the Great Renewal was built.

[h2|4549a4e2-26dc-4b5d-9277-631de6bbf073]Personality[/h2]
Poised, gracious, silent, melancholic. She is a consummate actress, hiding a deep well of grief and horror behind a mask of perfect piety.

[h2|fcb5cea2-37c2-4e9e-857f-60fc32438acf]Appearance[/h2]
Elegant and fine-boned, with long, pale blonde hair often worn in a severe but immaculate braid. Her eyes are a watery blue, frequently downcast. She projects a fragile beauty that belies a formidable inner strength and control.

[h2|d0beaf08-1c91-4b3c-bc24-b369660d7011]Goals[/h2]
To survive. To protect the memory of her annihilated family. And, if a safe opportunity ever arose, to witness the downfall of the regime that took everything from her.
