# Title: The Reach

**The Reach** is a sovereign human empire occupying a large, geographically diverse landmass on the western coast of the continent. Defined by the towering, iron-rich Mount Aethel at its heart and fertile plains giving way to rugged coastlines, The Reach is a realm of stark contrasts. For centuries, it was a feudal oligarchy, ruled by a council of powerful noble houses. However, a violent, faith-driven coup two years ago shattered this old order, transforming the nation into a unique and deeply divided hierocracy.
Recent History

## The Age of Oligarchs (Pre-Renewal):
Until the year 0 A.D. (After Dawn, year 48 after the fracture), The Reach was governed by its most powerful noble families. Each house controlled a vast territory and held a seat on a ruling council, with a rotating leadership that was often ineffective and paralyzed by infighting. This era was marked by the decadence and corruption of the southern houses and the strategic neglect of the outer domains. Noble ambition often took precedence over the welfare of the state, leading to widespread discontent that the nobility, in their arrogance, failed to address.

## The Great Renewal (Year 0 A.D., year 48 after the fracture):
Seeing the corruption of the oligarchs as a spiritual blight, the Priesthood of Aelios—the dragon god of the sun—launched a swift and brutal coup. The catalyst for this revolution was the revelation of [[Altarion, the Dawn Emperor]], a 10-year-old Dragonborn child whom the priests proclaimed to be the divine son of [[Aelios]] and the true, god-given ruler of the realm.

Hailed as the "Dawn Emperor," the child became a potent symbol around which the priests rallied the faithful and the disaffected. The coup, termed The Great Renewal, saw several noble houses completely annihilated, their castles razed, and their leaders publicly executed. The priests seized the capital of Dawnhold and a large swathe of the surrounding lands, establishing it as the Royal Province, the inviolable domain of their new God Emperor.

## Government and Current Political Structure
The Reach is now a hierocracy, ruled by the Priesthood of Aelios. True power resides not with the young Emperor, but with the Council of Luminars, a body of high-priests who act as his regents and interpret the will of Aelios. They have instituted the "Law of Light," a strict legal and social code that demands public piety and transparency, a direct reaction to the shadowy dealings of the old nobility.

The surviving noble families were subjugated and reconstituted as the "Pledged Houses." They retain control over their ancestral lands as the secular arm of the state, responsible for tax collection and local administration, but are each monitored by a priest-advisor or "Luminar." The political landscape is now defined by the varied stances of these houses:

- Loyalists: Led by the fanatically devout House Vorlag of the north, who have thrived under the new regime and act as its staunchest military ally.
- Conspirators: A secret alliance of nobles known as the Shadow Court plots to restore the old order. This faction is masterminded by the cunning House Valerius of Sunseat and backed by the military might of the resentful House Drogan of Skyreach.
- Pragmatists: Houses like the opportunistic House Clemence play both sides, offering stability to the hierocracy while keeping channels open to the rebels, waiting to see which way the political winds will shift.
- The Divided & The Broken: Other houses remain trapped by circumstance. House Corvin is torn by internal dissent between its traditionalist lord and his faithful daughter, while the shattered House Sunder remains a terrified vassal of the Royal Province, a living monument to the price of defiance.


## Outlook
Today, The Reach exists in a state of precarious stability. On the surface, it is a realm united in faith under a divine ruler. Beneath this veneer, it is a cold war fought with spies, economic sabotage, and carefully coded messages. The border between House Drogan's domain and the Royal Province is a military flashpoint, while the port of Sunseat serves as the financial engine of a growing rebellion. The future of The Reach hinges on a few critical questions: When will the Shadow Court decide to act? Can the Priesthood root out the conspiracy before it erupts into open war? And most importantly, what will happen when the boy-god Altarion grows of age?
