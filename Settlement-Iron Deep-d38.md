# Title: Iron Deep

In the heart of the formidable mountain range known as Drakar Peaks, where the stone is as steadfast as the dwarves who call it home, lies the city of Iron Deep. Founded by the legendary [[Erikkul Ironheart]]Â , the city is a marvel of dwarven engineering and the epitome of their indomitable spirit. It's said that Erikkul discovered a vein of "Royal Iron," a rare and magical metal, and knew that he had found the perfect place to build a kingdom that would stand the test of time.
As you walk through the grand archways of Iron Deep, the echoes of forges meld with hearty laughter in the deep halls of stone. The air is thick with the smell of molten metal and the promise of craftsmanship that is unparalleled in all of Eldoria. Here, in these hallowed halls, resides the current King Thraindor Ironheart and his Queen Traina Ironheart, direct descendants of the city's founder. They sit upon the Iron Throne, a seat of power and a historical artifact, crafted from the weapons of the clan's greatest heroes. It's not just a throne; it's a symbol of the clan's enduring legacy and their unyielding commitment to their people and their craft.

The governance of Iron Deep is a complex affair, a delicate balance between the needs of the clan and the greater good of the kingdom. The Ironheart clan, known for their valor and mastery in metallurgy, have the challenging task of ruling not just their own people but also the diverse clans that make up Drakar Peaks. The High Council of the Peaks, consisting of master craftsmen from each of the six major clans, often convenes here, in chambers adorned with intricate stonework and lit by the warm glow of forge fires.
