# Title: Gavril Valerius

Gavril is the perfect courtier and an essential part of the Valerius machine. His apparent lack of seriousness causes the dour priests to underestimate him, an error he exploits at every opportunity. While his sister Aris is the mind of the conspiracy, Gavril is its charming, public-facing dagger.

[h2|f13292d6-82a8-4e6a-b260-2167605baac2]Personality[/h2]
Charming, witty, observant, deceptively frivolous. He plays the part of a reformed rake, using his charisma as both a weapon and a shield.

[h2|dce3189e-dae1-49fa-bc18-14f41e140305]Appearance[/h2]
Conventionally handsome, with an easy smile and the confident posture of a man used to being admired. He keeps his hair fashionably long and dresses in the latest styles from Dawnhold, always looking impeccable.

[h2|5f15efe1-71c8-4702-a30a-4bc36f23c25c]Goals[/h2]
To serve his sister's strategic aims. He acts as her eyes and ears in the capital, building relationships, gathering gossip, and distracting the hierocracy's attention from Sunseat.
