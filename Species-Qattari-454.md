# Title: Qattari

The Qattari, or Catfolk, are a resilient and mystical people, shaped by the harsh yet awe-inspiring landscape of Raml Al-Hamsa, the desert they call home. Their fur and eyes shining in as many colours as are thinkable, are as much a part of the desert as the shifting sands and whispering winds, a testament to their deep-rooted connection to the land. Nomadic by nature, they traverse the expansive dunes in arcane caravans, guided by the stars and ancient wisdom passed down through generations. Each tribe has its own unique customs and specialties, from the art of Sandforging to the celestial magic of the Starcallers, but all share a common reverence for the mystical and natural worlds.
Spirituality and community are the cornerstones of Qattari society. The desert is not just a geographical feature for them; it's a living entity, a teacher, and a spiritual guide. This deep connection to the land and the arcane is reflected in their daily rituals, storytelling, and even their language, Sahiri. The Qattari are also known for their hospitality and generosity, a cultural trait born out of the harsh necessities of desert life. In a land where resources are scarce, cooperation and goodwill are not just virtues but survival strategies.

Despite the challenges posed by their environment, the Qattari have not just survived but thrived, creating a rich tapestry of traditions, knowledge, and art. They are skilled artisans, musicians, and alchemists, their wares sought after in markets far beyond the boundaries of Al-Qattara.
