# Title: House Sunder

House Sunder serves as the hierocracy's most potent cautionary tale. Once proud lords of a prosperous domain, they were shattered for resisting the Great Renewal too fiercely. Their lands were largely annexed by the Royal Province, their leader executed, and their keep left as a crumbling ruin. The current lord, the young and traumatized **Rhys Sunder**, is paralyzed by fear and offers nothing but terrified compliance. True leadership rests with his aunt, **Morwen Sunder**, a woman consumed by a burning desire for vengeance. Isolated and powerless, she desperately seeks contact with the Shadow Court, hoping to offer what little remains of her house in exchange for a chance to strike back at the powers that destroyed her family.
