# Title: The Grand Library

# Exterior
The Grand Library stands as a monumental testament to the pursuit of knowledge. Its walls are made of enchanted marble, which seems to shimmer under different lighting conditions. Tall columns, adorned with intricate carvings of famous scholars, sages, and magical symbols, support the entryway. The library's grand wooden doors are carved with runes of protection and knowledge, beckoning those who seek wisdom to enter.

# Interior

- Upon entering, visitors are greeted by a vast, multi-leveled hall filled with rows upon rows of shelves stretching out seemingly endlessly. These shelves house ancient tomes, scrolls, and magical artifacts from all corners of Eldoria and beyond.
- Magical orbs of light float around, illuminating the space and adjusting their brightness based on the time of day and the needs of the readers.
- Ladders on wheels and floating platforms facilitate access to higher shelves, ensuring that even the most obscure piece of knowledge can be reached.
- There are also specialized reading areas, some secluded for deep concentration and others more open for group studies or discussions.
- At the center of the library stands a grand desk, where librarians assist visitors, and where Professor Elias Quillhart can often be seen engrossed in a tome or aiding a student.
- Hidden alcoves and private study rooms are scattered throughout, providing places for scholars to dive deep into their research without distractions.
- The library also features several enchanted displays that showcase particularly rare or valuable artifacts, each protected by a series of spells.
