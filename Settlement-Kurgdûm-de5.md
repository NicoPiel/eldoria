# Title: Kurgdûm

Situated near the "head" of the Behemoth, with its main gate opening through the creature's vast, jawless mouth-cave. As the gateway to the outside world, Kurgdûm is the most cosmopolitan and finely decorated of the holds. It contains the grand markets, the embassies for any allied surface-dwellers, the Great Library, and the Forgefather's central temple. It is designed to awe and impress visitors and traders.
