# Title: Urk-a-Barâk

Carved from the massive, stable bones of the Behemoth's pelvic girdle. Urk-a-Barâk is a city of grand quarries, design studios, and colossal workshops. Here, the Grand Carver and their clan design and pre-fabricate the architectural elements used throughout the kingdom. It is an orderly, grid-like city filled with the sounds of precise carving and the scent of stone dust.
