# Title: Anvil's Rest

Located in the northwestern region of Drakar Peaks, near the kingdom's primary trade routes, lies Anvil's Rest. Founded by the diplomatic genius, Thrain Silverstream, the city serves as the kingdom's gateway to the outside world. Thrain, recognizing the importance of trade and alliances, chose a location near the surface and established the first subterranean dock in dwarven history, known as the "Silverport."
As you approach Anvil's Rest, you notice its openness compared to other dwarven cities. The ceilings are higher, the halls wider, designed to accommodate traders and diplomats from various races and cultures. Here, the Silverstream clan excels in the art of negotiation, skilled traders and diplomats who ensure the prosperity and alliances of Drakar Peaks.

Governance in Anvil's Rest is a complex web of trade agreements and diplomatic treaties. The ruling council, made up of the clan's most skilled negotiators, meets in the "Chamber of Alliances," a grand hall adorned with flags and emblems from various kingdoms and races. This chamber serves as a constant reminder of the clan's crucial role in maintaining the kingdom's external relations.

Trade in Anvil's Rest is diverse, dealing in goods from all over the world. The Silverport is a marvel of engineering, a subterranean dock that accommodates trade caravans and even small ships. The port is the lifeline of the city, and by extension, the kingdom, facilitating the exchange of dwarven crafts for exotic goods and resources.

Here, where commerce and diplomacy are the lifeblood of daily existence, there exists another, deeper layer of the city's identity: its role as the spiritual and religious hub of Drakar Peaks. At the heart of this spiritual landscape is the grand temple known as the "Sanctum of Flames," a magnificent structure of intricately carved stone and molten metal, dedicated primarily to Kardain Flamebeard, the Forgefather. The temple is not just a place of worship; it's a living testament to the dwarven mastery of forging and craftsmanship, its walls adorned with reliefs depicting the Forgefather's legendary deeds and its altars made from the finest metals, imbued with divine blessings.
The clergy of Anvil's Rest are a unique blend of spiritual leaders and skilled artisans. Known as the "Flamekeepers," they serve dual roles as priests and master blacksmiths, embodying the essence of Kardain Flamebeard in both prayer and craft. The Flamekeepers are responsible for maintaining the Sanctum's eternal flame, a sacred fire said to have been kindled by the Forgefather himself. This flame is used in various religious ceremonies and rites, from the blessing of new forges to the anointing of young dwarves entering their first apprenticeships. It's believed that weapons and armor forged in this divine flame carry the blessings of the Forgefather, offering protection and guidance to those who wield them.

But the influence of the Flamekeepers extends beyond the walls of the Sanctum. They are spiritual advisors to the ruling council, providing guidance in matters that require divine intervention or wisdom. They also serve as mediators in trade agreements, ensuring that all transactions align with the ethical and spiritual values of the dwarven community. The Flamekeepers are revered not just for their religious authority but also for their diplomatic acumen, a reflection of Anvil's Rest's unique role as both a commercial and spiritual center. In a city where trade and faith intersect, the Flamekeepers stand as pillars of a society that values both worldly gains and divine blessings.
