# Title: House Vorlag

House Vorlag is a martial house with a long history of defending The Reach's harsh northern frontier. Formerly a remote and often overlooked power, they have become the hierocracy's most fervent and powerful ally. Under the leadership of the zealously devout **Lord **[[Cassian Vorlag]], the house embraced the Great Renewal as a divine mandate, leveraging their loyalty to ascend from a backwater warden to the preeminent power in the north. Their military provides critical support to the Royal Province, and their territory acts as a loyalist bastion against rebellion. This fanaticism is complicated by Lord Cassian's wife, Lady [[Fiana Vorlag]], a survivor of a destroyed house who harbors a secret, profound grief and dissent.
