# Title: Thran-az-Hyrth

The Shieldmaidens do not have a single, subterranean hold. True to their nature, their "city" is a network of smaller, fortified settlements on the surface—the "skin"—of the Behemoth. Thran-az-Hyrth is a series of watchtowers built on the highest spinal peaks, interconnected by swaying bridges and semi-subterranean halls burrowed just deep enough for shelter from the worst storms. It is the only dwarven settlement open to the sky.
