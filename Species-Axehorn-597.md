# Title: Axehorn

A formidable beast resembling a cross between a rhinoceros and a boar. Its thick hide is almost impenetrable, and its horns can break through solid stone with ease, making it both a revered symbol of strength among the dwarves and a significant challenge for any hunter. Its hide is incredibly thick and tough, resistant to many conventional weapons. This characteristic makes the Axehorn both an intimidating predator and a challenging prey. The two horns are the most notable feature of the Axehorn. They are made of solid bone and can break through stone with ease. Each horn weighs several hundred pounds and is adorned with intricate carvings, which are considered sacred among the dwarves.
