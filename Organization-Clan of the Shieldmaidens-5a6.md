# Title: Clan of the Shieldmaidens

A clan composed exclusively of women, the Shieldmaidens are the hardy explorers and survivalists who live on the "skin" of the Behemoth. This tradition dates back to the legendary "Sisters of the First Frost," an expedition where only the women survived a supernatural blizzard. As a result, the clan believes that only women possess the unique spirit and endurance needed to guard the kingdom's surface. They patrol the icy mountain exteriors, serving as scouts, first-line defenders, and masters of navigating by the sun, moon, and stars—concepts foreign to their deep-dwelling kin. Because Shieldmaidens must take partners from other clans, their family ties weave through the entire kingdom, giving them a unique and broad perspective on dwarven society.

## The Legend
In the early centuries of the kingdom, the surface of the Behemoth was considered an impassable, cursed wasteland. The first major expedition to chart the peaks was caught in a sudden, unnaturally cold blizzard that lasted for a month. All the men on the expedition, despite their strength, succumbed to the cold or were lost in the whiteouts. Only the women survived, through their superior endurance, ingenuity in creating shelters, and a shared resilience that became legendary. They were called the "Sisters of the First Frost."
In their honor, and as a grim acknowledgment of the mountain's particular wrath, the clan dedicated to patrolling the surface was established as a matriarchal institution. To this day, they believe that only women possess the specific type of resilience and spirit required to endure the "cold malice" of the open sky.

## Societal Impact
### Family & Lineage:
This creates a unique social dynamic. A Shieldmaiden must take a husband or partner from another clan.
Daughters born to a Shieldmaiden are raised with the expectation that they will become Aspirants for the clan. The pressure to follow in their mother's footsteps is immense.
Sons born to a Shieldmaiden know from birth that they can never join their mother's clan. This might foster a special kind of ambition in these boys, a drive to make a name for themselves in one of the other five clans. A Shieldmaiden mother would take great pride in her son's success in, for example, the [[Clan of the Hammers]] or @boneh.

### Inter-Clan Relations:
The Shieldmaidens become a unique social "glue." Because they must partner outside their clan, their family ties spread like a web throughout the entire kingdom, connecting all the other clans by blood and marriage in a way no other clan does. This gives them a surprisingly broad base of informal influence.

### The Proving:
The Proving for a Shieldmaiden Aspirant would be the most physically grueling of all, focusing on endurance, survival, and lone-vigil tests in the harshest conditions on the Behemoth's "skin."
