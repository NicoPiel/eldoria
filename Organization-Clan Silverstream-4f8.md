# Title: Clan Silverstream

# Overview
Clan Silverstream is one of the oldest and most respected dwarven clans in Drakar Peaks. Founded by the legendary Thrain Silverstream, they are the spiritual custodians of Anvil's Rest and the keepers of the Eternal Flame. Known for their deep religious convictions, mastery of metallurgy, and unyielding commitment to tradition, Clan Silverstream holds a unique place in dwarven society.
# Characteristics
Members of Clan Silverstream are easily recognizable by their silver-white beards and intricately braided hair, often adorned with small tokens made of Royal Iron. They are generally serious and introspective, valuing wisdom, piety, and craftsmanship above all else.
# Roles and Responsbilities
The clan is responsible for maintaining the Heartforge and overseeing religious ceremonies in Anvil's Rest. They are also the guardians of the Eternal Flame and the first vein of Royal Iron. The clan's scholars are experts in dwarven history, theology, and the arcane arts, often serving as advisors to other clans and even other races.
# Economic Contributions
While not as economically powerful as some other clans due to their focus on spiritual matters, Clan Silverstream is renowned for their craftsmanship, particularly in religious artifacts and ceremonial weapons. Their work is highly sought after, and they trade these items for essential goods and services.
# Political Influence
As the keepers of Anvil's Rest, Clan Silverstream has significant political influence, especially in matters concerning religion and tradition. While they may not have the economic clout of clans based in Iron Deep, their spiritual authority is unquestioned.
# Current Leadership
The clan is currently led by Dagna Silverstream, a direct descendant of Thrain. She is both the political and spiritual leader of the clan, responsible for maintaining the delicate balance between tradition and the needs of modern dwarven society.
Challenges and Aspirations

The clan faces the challenge of keeping the younger generation engaged in traditional practices while adapting to a rapidly changing world. They aspire to spread the teachings of Kardain Flamebeard and ensure that the Eternal Flame burns for generations to come.
